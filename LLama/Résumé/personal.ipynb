       "1. **Data Science Skills:** Your resume showcases a good balance of theoretical knowledge and practical experience in data science, machine learning, and MLOps. You've highlighted various projects, certifications, and skills relevant to the job. However, the job description emphasizes \"advanced statistical analysis\" and \"predictive modeling techniques,\" which might require more explicit mentioning in your resume.\n",
       "2. **Lack of Industry Experience:** While you've compensated for the lack of direct work experience with a strong portfolio on GitHub, the job description explicitly mentions \"0 to 3 years of experience in a data science role, preferably within the biopharma or pharmaceutical industry.\" This might be a gap in your resume.\n",
       "3. **Domain Knowledge:** The job description focusses on pharmaceuticals and working with healthcare data. Your resume doesn't explicitly demonstrate experience or knowledge in this domain. You might consider adding relevant coursework, certifications, or side projects that showcase your understanding of the pharmaceutical industry.\n",

       "3. **Include domain-specific experience or knowledge:** If you have any coursework, projects, or certifications related to pharmaceuticals or healthcare data, add them to your resume to demonstrate domain knowledge.\n",
       "4. **Quantify achievements:** Consider adding metrics or accomplishments to your portfolio projects to provide more context to the recruiter.\n",
       "5. **Visuals and verbosity:** Your resume has a lot of information condensed into short paragraphs. Consider using bullet points and shorter sentences to improve readability.\n",
