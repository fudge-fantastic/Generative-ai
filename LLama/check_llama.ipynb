       "            count -= 1\n",
       "    return current\n",
       "```\n",
       "Here's an explanation of how the function works:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. We initialize a `current` pointer to the head of the list, and a `count` variable to 0.\n",
       "2. We traverse the list, incrementing `count` each time we move to the next node, until `count` reaches `k`.\n",
       "3. If `count` reaches `k`, we recursively call the `reverseKGroup` function on the remaining nodes.\n",
       "4. We then iterate `k` times, reversing the order of the nodes in the current group. We do this by swapping the `next` pointers of adjacent nodes.\n",
       "5. Finally, we return the new head of the reversed group.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, if you have a linked list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and you call `reverseKGroup(head, 3)`, the resulting list would be [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8].\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that this function assumes that the input list is a singly linked list, and that the `k` parameter is a positive integer. Also, this function only works for lists that can be divided evenly into groups of size `k`. If the list has a length that is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes will not be reversed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, this is a recursive solution, which can be limited by the maximum recursion depth. For a large `k` or a very long list, this function can exceed the maximum recursion depth and cause a stack overflow. An iterative solution is generally preferred for such cases.\n",
