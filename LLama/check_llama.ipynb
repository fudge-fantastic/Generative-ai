       "    return current\n",
       "```\n",
       "Here's an explanation of how the function works:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. We initialize a `current` pointer to the head of the list, and a `count` variable to 0.\n",
       "2. We traverse the list, incrementing `count` each time we move to the next node, until `count` reaches `k`.\n",
       "3. If `count` reaches `k`, we recursively call the `reverseKGroup` function on the remaining nodes.\n",
       "4. We then iterate `k` times, reversing the order of the nodes in the current group. We do this by swapping the `next` pointers of adjacent nodes.\n",
       "5. Finally, we return the new head of the reversed group.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, if you have a linked list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and you call `reverseKGroup(head, 3)`, the resulting list would be [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8].\n",
       "\n",
       "Note that this function assumes that the input list is a singly linked list, and that the `k` parameter is a positive integer. Also, this function only works for lists that can be divided evenly into groups of size `k`. If the list has a length that is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes will not be reversed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, this is a recursive solution, which can be limited by the maximum recursion depth. For a large `k` or a very long list, this function can exceed the maximum recursion depth and cause a stack overflow. An iterative solution is generally preferred for such cases.\n",

       "**Collaborative Filtering (User-based)**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend items based on similarities between users.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Content-Based Filtering**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Attribute-Based Filtering**: Recommend items based on their attributes (e.g., genre, author, etc.).\n",
       "2. **Hybrid Content-Based Filtering**: Combines attribute-based with other filtering methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Hybrid Systems**\n",

       "1. **Hybrid Collaborative Filtering**: Combines user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.\n",

       "1. **Rule-Based Systems**: Recommend items based on predefined rules and constraints.\n",
       "2. ** ontology-Based Systems**: Represent and reason about domain-specific knowledge.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sequential and Session-Based Systems**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Sequential Recommendation**: Recommend next item based on previous interactions.\n",
       "2. **Session-Based Recommendation**: Recommend items based on a user's current browsing or interaction sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Embedding-Based Methods**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Word Embeddings**: Apply word embeddings to recommend similar items.\n",
       "2. **Matrix Factorization**: Factorize the user-item interaction matrix to generate embeddings.\n",
       "3. **Deep Learning-Based Embeddings**: Use neural networks to learn embeddings.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Graph-Based Methods**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Graph-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend items based on graph representations of user-item interactions.\n",

       "**Other**\n",

       "1. **Demographic Systems**: Recommend items based on user demographics.\n",
       "2. **Knowledge-Guided Systems**: Integrate knowledge graphs into recommendation systems.\n",
       "3. **Explainable Recommendation**: Provide transparency into recommendation methods.\n",
       "4. **Time-Aware Systems**: Consider temporal aspects of user behavior.\n",
       "5. **Context-Aware Systems**: Adapt recommendations based on available context (e.g., location, time).\n",

       "\t* supports multiple languages, including Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, and many more.\n",
       "\t* Can be used with any programming language that can send HTTP requests.\n",
       "3. **PyOCR** (Python):\n",
       "\t* A Python library that wraps multiple OCR engines, including Tesseract, OCR.space, and GOCR.\n",
       "\t* Simple to use and flexible, with support for many languages.\n",
       "4. **GOCR** (C/C++/Java/.NET']:\n",

       "* If you're using Python and want a flexible library that wraps multiple OCR engines, PyOCR might be the perfect fit.\n",
